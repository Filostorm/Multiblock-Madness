    B:"Enforce Block Costs"=true

    # If true, when new world chunks are generated, no mobs from this mod will pre-spawn (mobs will still attempt to spawn randomly afterwards). Set this to true if you are removing mobs from vanilla dimensions as the vanilla WorldGen spawning ignores mob spawn conditions.

    # If true, when water mobs spawn, instead of checking the light level of the block the mob is spawning at, the light level of the surface (if possible) is checked. This stops mobs like Jengus from spawning at the bottom of deep rivers during the day, set to false for the old way.
