# Multiblock-Madness
Bored of the normal expert packs out there? Try Multiblock Madness! We've got exploration, dimensions, 3D crafting, and a slew of multiblock machines that do everything from collect lunar energy to killing virtual mobs to processing various types of metals.
 
Many mod items are tweaked to be more useful, for example, most charges from Lycanites Mobs drops can now be converted into resources!
 
Over 600 Quests!
 
Jei has been cleaned up, no more seeing that every block can be painted and enchanted with Vanishing!
 
    Take on all new mobs with Lycanites Mobs, Ice and Fire, and Animania. (Normal hostile mobs still spawn)
 
    Venture into the Twilight Forest, explore the Betweenlands, and brave the hostile yet rewarding Beneath.
 
 
Using Compact Machines 3D Miniaturization feature, craft a variety of machine frames and magical items.
 
Create the ultimate material processing factory and build the most advanced machines.
 
     Make use of a custom 8x ore processing system through Rockhounding.
 
    Use Immersive Engineering's Excavators with custom mineral veins to generate large amounts of ore mid game, then dive into chemistry with Rockhounding 
    (complete with a quest page that will take you through the mod) to extract surprisingly large amounts of resources from Uninspected Minerals and 
    smelt efficiency boosting alloys.
 
    Revamped ore gen; most ore now spawns in fairly large clusters with other related ores.
 
Empower yourself with Astral Sorcery, find powerful spells and trinkets with Electroblobs Wizardry, become the ultimate ritualist through Blood Magic, and tame the Void with Thaumcraft.
 
As of version 0.3.0, the first four Questbook chapters are done, so have fun
